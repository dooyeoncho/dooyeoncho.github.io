			<div><span>Dooyeon Cho and Husang Kim construct a new Korea economic policy uncertainty index based on 13 Korean major newspapers. In addition to the new overall EPU index, monthly 
        category-specific policy uncertainty indices from January 1990 are available in the following four categories: i) Monetary policy, ii) Fiscal policy, 
        iii) Trade policy, and iv) Foreign Exchange (FX) policy.
